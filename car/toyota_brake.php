		<div style="color: white; text-align:center;text-align:justify;">The 86 was designed around a front-mounted boxer engine, rear-wheel drive configuration, inspired by the AE86. The flat architecture of the boxer engine allows it to be mounted low, dropping the center of gravity down, resulting in sporty handling characteristics. The exterior design of the 86 delivers a slippery drag coefficient and was inspired by the Toyota 2000GT's low-to-the-ground profile and long, sleek hood.</div><br>
